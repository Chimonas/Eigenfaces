# Eigenfaces

## First push:
**facealigner:**<br />
  Contains a function that takes a picture and resizes, crops, rotates the picture with the face centered. Utilizes OpenCV and dLib <br />
  **dataImporting:**<br />
  Preprocess the data (fnames: indian_faces and data) and saves them to a new file<br />
 
## Goals:
  Preprocess data and put them in a file (Done)<br />
  Implement PCA and N-PCA - procedures for dimensionality reduction by identifing the most importantt features (eigenvalues)<br />
  Implement eigenfaces using both methods<br />
  Implement different classification algorithms (KNN, CNN, probablistic)<br />
 
  
Still didn't start on the paper. <br />
