# Eigenfaces

## First push:
**facealigner:**
  Contains a function that takes a picture and resizes, crops, rotates the picture with the face centered. Utilizes OpenCV and dLib
**dataImporting:**
  Preprocess the data (fnames: indian_faces and data) and saves them to a new file
 
## Goals:
  Preprocess data and put them in a file (Done)
  Implement PCA and N-PCA - procedures for dimensionality reduction by identifing the most importantt features (eigenvalues)
  Implement eigenfaces using both methods
  Implement different classification algorithms (KNN, CNN, probablistic)
  
  
Still didn't start on the paper.
